When reporting issues with commands, please include all relevant details of the trigger.
If possible, attach the message itself and provide information such as:
  - Was the message plain-text? Was it an image?
    - If it was an image, did it have a caption? Was the caption supposed to trigger a command?
  - Was the message a reply?
    - If yes, was it a reply to your message? Someone else's? DankBot's?
    - Was it a reply to an image? A plain-text message?
  - Was the message sent in a group chat? Or was it a direct message to DankBot?

When reporting all others bugs, please provide as many information as possible.
